## Contributing

There are several ways you could contribute to the development.

-   Pull requests are always welcome! You could contribute code by fixing bugs, adding new features or automated tests. Take a look at the [bug tracker](https://github.com/adityathakurxd/Calculator-AndroidApp/issues) for ideas where to start. It is also preferable to target issues in the current milestone.
    
-   Make sure to read our contribution guidelines before starting to code.
    
-   Another way to contribute is by providing translations for languages, or improving translations. 

For development, it is recommended to use the **Android Studio for development** which is available for free. Import the project into the IDE using the build.gradle file. The IDE will resolve dependencies automatically.
